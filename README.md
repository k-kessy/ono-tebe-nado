# ono-tebe-nado 

**ono-tebe-nado** - project marks my first foray into layout design as part of the ``Semantic and Layout`` sprint on the [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) course.

 **ono-tebe-nado** - page layout telling about an auction with things too complicated or, on the contrary, too simple. Ahead of its time. Torn to pieces by critics. Unaccepted and misunderstood. Once they seemed simply unsuccessful. But despite the criticism, the seeming simplicity or complexity, it is now impossible to imagine modern culture without these lots. When no one believed in these things, their creators continued to believe. And now these lots have become iconic.
